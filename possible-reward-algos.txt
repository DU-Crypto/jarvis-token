POW - Easiest to implement and the most tried and true. If we decide to go this route the following considerations must be addressed
* Which algorithm will be use (SHA, Scrypt, Cryptonite, etc)
* What is the reward scheme (50 tokens, 25, 12.5, does it halve, third, etc, and how much time)
* Total allocation && will there be premining if so what percentage

POS - If we decide on POS we have to consider the following
* How will be do block selection (randomized block selection vs coin-age based selection vs something brand new)
* Will we run masternodes?

On a personal note I lean towards POW
